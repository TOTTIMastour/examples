# Paremus Service Fabric #
### A distributed OSGi based Cloud platform ###

[Introduction](https://docs.paremus.com/display/SF111/Introduction)

##Examples: 

[helloworld](https://github.com/paremus/examples/tree/master/helloworld) - A simple sequence of Hello World examples which demonstrate the following Fabric behaviours ([see related documentation](http://docs.paremus.com/display/SF111/Hello+Tutorial)):
* The light-weight Nimble R5 environment with Declarative Services and Blueprint 
* The equivalent 'Fabric' (OSGi Cloud) - example
* Use of Fibre Assessors 
* Features and Resource Contracts 
* Use of the Fabric's Remote Services
* Upgrade and RollBack capabilities

The following examples introduce the Fabric's DOSGi capabilities [see related documentation](http://docs.paremus.com/display/SF111/Distributed+OSGi):
* Use of the Fabric's Remote Services
* Example of the Fabric's dynamic Scale Out via replication handlers. 
* Example of the Fabric's load-balancer behavior. 

The final set of examples demonstrate the Fabric's ability to deploy and manage traditional software artefacts [see related documentation](http://docs.paremus.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=5080069): 
* The [Rest](https://github.com/paremus/examples/tree/master/rest) Demonstrates Fabric deployment and dynamic wire-up of REST based Services.
* The [JEE](https://github.com/paremus/examples/tree/master/javaee) Demonstrates Fabric deployment of traditional JEE application; including the choice of application Server (GlassFish or JBoss).  
* The [Redis](https://github.com/paremus/examples/tree/master/redis) Demonstrates Fabric deployment use of the Redis Key-Value store.
* The [nginx](https://github.com/paremus/examples/tree/master/nginx) example demonstrates the Fabric deployment and dynamic configuration of nginx endpoints.
